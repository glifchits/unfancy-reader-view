refuses to style their webpage. In this age of glitz and excess, the ability to
resist the temptation to splash a webpage with colour and animations is to be
lauded.

However, I find it hard to read blocks of text that are as wide as my computer
screen. So I made this, a really simple Chrome extension that makes plain HTML
pages readable.
